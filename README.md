Ansible Role Docker server
=========

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Turgon37/ansible-docker-server.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Turgon37/ansible-docker-server)

:warning: This role is under development, some important (and possibly breaking) changes may happend. Don't use it in production level environments but you can eventually base your own role on this one :hammer:

:grey_exclamation: Before using this role, please know that all my Ansible roles are fully written and accustomed to my IT infrastructure. So, even if they are as generic as possible they will not necessarily fill your needs, I advice you to carrefully analyse what they do and evaluate their capability to be installed securely on your servers.

**This roles configure the docker daemon.**

## Features

Currently this role provide the following features :

  * docker engine installation
  * docker engine configuration
  * docker engine systemd service file
  * install the docker-compose tool
    * use the native tool for x86 architectures
    * use a workaround script + compiled docker image for some other platforms (only armhf for now)
  * monitoring items for
    * Zabbix
  * [local facts](#facts)

## Requirements

### OS Family

This role is available for

  * Debian/Raspbian 8/9

:exclamation: In a production environment I recommend to set docker_server__service_restartable to False and to handle manually the docker service's restarts

### Socket privileged users configuration

If any of your configured docker listen hosts contains 'unix://' string this role will configure a unix system group to secure it.
Then, you can add some users to this group by using the following configuration:

```
docker_server__socket_group_users:
  - userlogin1
```

If you want to revoke user socket access

```
docker_server__socket_group_users:
  - name: userlogin1
    state: absent
```

## Facts

By default the local fact are installed and expose all variables available with the docker info command line.

You can use this command to get an idea of available keys

```
docker version --format '{{json .}}'
```

In addition, the following facts are available about docker-compose

* ```ansible_local.docker_compose.version_full```
* ```ansible_local.docker_compose.version_major```


## Examples Playbooks

To use this role create or update your playbook according the following examples :

  * Exemple of configuration with specific storage driver

```
    - hosts: servers
      roles:
         - docker-server
      vars:
        storage-driver: devicemapper
        storage-opts:
          - 'dm.thinpooldev=/dev/mapper/docker-thinpool'
          - 'dm.use_deferred_removal=true'
          - 'dm.use_deferred_deletion=true'
```
